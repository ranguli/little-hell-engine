/** @struct Drawable 
 *
 *  Drawable is any 2D element shown on screen that is not part of the game world. 
 *
 *  For example, the ammo counter is a Drawable, an enemy or barrel is not. More specifically, 
 *  Drawable provides high-level functions to easily draw a texture (known in DOOM jargon as a 
 *  patch) to the screen. Fundamentally every on-screen element (that is not part of the 
 *  gameworld) is one or more textures (patches) all the way down. 
 
 *  If we're drawing a texture such as the icon for the blue keycard, we simply use the Drawable
 *  type and assign its texture to the blue keycard texture found in the WAD. 
 *
 *  However, DOOM doesn't support the loading or drawing of abritrary fonts and images on the 
 *  filesystem. Those must be textures of some kind, and they must exist in the WAD. So, if we
 *  want to draw numbers or strings to the screen, (whether they be used as ammo counters in the
 *  case of numbers, menu items or chat messages in the case of strings, etc) we're really drawing
 *  a series of individual textures for each alphanumeric symbol.
 *
 *  To expand upon the basic functionality of texture loading and drawing provided by Drawable,
 *  a member sub_type (`DrawableSubType`) is present. This is an enum containing values for valid
 *  sub-types. If no sub-type is being used, the enum value is simply `DRAWABLE`.
 *
 *  Examples of such sub-types are those used to faciliate drawing numbers and strings in a high-
 *  level manner. A sub-type value of `NUMBER` denotes that a `NumberDrawable` will be used. 
 *  A sub-type value of `TEXT` denotes that a TextDrawable will be used. If no sub-type will be
 *  used, the value is just `DRAWABLE`.
 *
 *  @var Drawable::sub_type 
 *  Which sub-type of drawable we are using. Sub-types faciliate operations such as drawing
 *  numbers or text in a high-level manner. A sub-type (`DRAWABLE`) indicates that no sub-
 *  type is used, and we are just drawing a texture.
 *
 *  @var Drawable::data 
 *  Data that is specific to each sub-type. If no sub-type is used, this field can be
 *  ignored.
 *
 *  @var Drawable::enabled
 *  Whether or note the Drawable should be updated. 
 *
 *  @var Drawable::value
 *  The value that the Drawable should draw to the screen.
 * 
 *  @var Drawable::use_large_font
 *
